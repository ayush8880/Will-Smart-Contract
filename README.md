# Will-Smart-Contract

Created my first smart contract with the help of udemy course inn which i have used two modifiers called onlyOwner and jaisemara for specific access. The code simply stores payable family wallets addresses and amount linked to the address. The amount is entered by the Owner and the amount is tracnsacted when the owner of the code is dead.

This Smart Contract was build on a Test Net platform Remix IDE.
